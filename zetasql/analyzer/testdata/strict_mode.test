# This file tests strict mode queries, where we have more restrictive rules
# and get some additional errors, but never get different results.
#
# In this file, we don't show the resolved AST because it's not normally
# interesting.
# Queries showing no output passed in both modes and gave identical output.
# Queries showing only ERROR: gave the same error in both modes.
# Queries showing STRICT MODE ERROR: gave that error in strict mode.  If they
# also have ERROR:, they failed in default mode with a different error message.
#
# In other files, we always run the query in both default and strict mode, and
# verify that we never get success in strict with failure in non-strict, and
# that if both succeed, they give identical resolved ASTs, but we don't show
# the strict mode error messages.
