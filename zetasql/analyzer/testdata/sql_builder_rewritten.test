# This file shows the results of running rewritten ResolvedAST tree through the
# SQLBuilder. Ideally the SQL builder should operate both on the output of the
# analyzer and on the output of the rewriter as well. Sometimes we need to do
# specific work in the SQLBuilder component to handle shapes that the analyzer
# does not produce but the rewriter does, such as ResolvedWithExpr. This file
# includes tests that excercise such code and document its outputs.
