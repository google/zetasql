# Error tests for MEASURE type. Cases which are supposed to be errors should

# Set `no_run_sqlbuilder` as there is no syntax for specifying measures, so some
# intended (but not yet) invalid queries cannot be handled by SQL Builder.
# TODO: b/350555383 - Java support requires the ability to serialize and
# deserialize the measure type. This means serializing and deserializing the
# measure expression, which is tricky to do given circular dependencies. We
# workaround this by disabling java support for now. This should be removed
# once the serialization/deserialization is implemented.
