## `CORR`

```zetasql
CORR(
  X1, X2
  [ WHERE where_expression ]
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } having_expression ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]

over_clause:
  { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

window_specification:
  [ named_window ]
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
  [ window_frame_clause ]

```

**Description**

Returns the [Pearson coefficient][stat-agg-link-to-pearson-coefficient]
of correlation of a set of number pairs. For each number pair, the first number
is the dependent variable and the second number is the independent variable.
The return result is between `-1` and `1`. A result of `0` indicates no
correlation.

All numeric types are supported. If the
input is `NUMERIC` or `BIGNUMERIC` then the internal aggregation is
stable with the final output converted to a `DOUBLE`.
Otherwise the input is converted to a `DOUBLE`
before aggregation, resulting in a potentially unstable result.

This function ignores any input pairs that contain one or more `NULL` values. If
there are fewer than two input pairs without `NULL` values, this function
returns `NULL`.

`NaN` is produced if:

+ Any input value is `NaN`
+ Any input value is positive infinity or negative infinity.
+ The variance of `X1` or `X2` is `0`.
+ The covariance of `X1` and `X2` is `0`.

into this function, see

```

**Description**

Returns the population [covariance][stat-agg-link-to-covariance] of
a set of number pairs. The first number is the dependent variable; the second
number is the independent variable. The return result is between `-Inf` and
`+Inf`.

All numeric types are supported. If the
input is `NUMERIC` or `BIGNUMERIC` then the internal aggregation is
stable with the final output converted to a `DOUBLE`.
Otherwise the input is converted to a `DOUBLE`
before aggregation, resulting in a potentially unstable result.

This function ignores any input pairs that contain one or more `NULL` values. If
there is no input pair without `NULL` values, this function returns `NULL`.
If there is exactly one input pair without `NULL` values, this function returns
`0`.

`NaN` is produced if:

+ Any input value is `NaN`
+ Any input value is positive infinity or negative infinity.

/*---------+
 | results |
 +---------+
 | 16      |
 +---------*/
```

```zetasql
SELECT VAR_SAMP(x) AS results FROM UNNEST([10, 14, NULL]) AS x

/*---------+
 | results |
 +---------+
 | 8       |
 +---------*/
```

```zetasql
SELECT VAR_SAMP(x) AS results FROM UNNEST([10, NULL]) AS x

/*---------+

```

## `VARIANCE`

VARIANCE(
  [ DISTINCT ]
  expression
  [ WHERE where_expression ]
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } having_expression ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]

over_clause:
  { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

window_specification:
  [ named_window ]
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
  [ window_frame_clause ]
