# Function calls

When you call a function, specific rules may apply. You can also add the
`SAFE.` prefix, which prevents functions from generating some types of errors.
To learn more, see the next sections.

## Function call rules

The following rules apply to all built-in ZetaSQL functions unless
explicitly indicated otherwise in the function description:

+ If an operand is `NULL`, the function result is `NULL`.
+ For functions that are time zone sensitive, the default time zone,
  which is implementation defined, is used when a time zone isn't specified.

## Named arguments

```zetasql
named_argument => value
```

You can provide parameter arguments by name when calling some functions and
procedures. These arguments are called _named arguments_. An argument that isn't
named is called a _positional argument_.

+  Named arguments are optional, unless specified as required in the
   function signature.
+  Named arguments don't need to be in order.
+  You can specify positional arguments before named arguments.
+  You can't specify positional arguments after named arguments.
+  An optional positional argument that isn't used doesn't need to be added
   before a named argument.

**Examples**

These examples reference a function called `CountTokensInText`, which counts
the number of tokens in a paragraph. The function signature looks like this:

```zetasql
CountTokensInText(paragraph STRING, tokens ARRAY<STRING>, delimiters STRING)
```

`CountTokensInText` contains three arguments: `paragraph`, `tokens`, and
`delimiters`. `paragraph` represents a body of text to analyze,
`tokens` represents the tokens to search for in the paragraph,
and `delimiters` represents the characters that specify a boundary
between tokens in the paragraph.

This is a query that includes `CountTokensInText`
without named arguments:

```zetasql
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.',
  ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  ' .,!?()')
```

This is the query with named arguments:

```zetasql
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  paragraph => 'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.',
  tokens => ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  delimiters => ' .,!?()')
```

If named arguments are used, the order of the arguments doesn't matter. This
works:

```zetasql
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  tokens => ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  delimiters => ' .,!?()',
  paragraph => 'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.')
```

You can mix positional arguments and named arguments, as long as the positional
arguments in the function signature come first:

```zetasql
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.',
  tokens => ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  delimiters => ' .,!?()')
```

This doesn't work because a positional argument appears after a named argument:

```zetasql
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  paragraph => 'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.',
  ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  delimiters => ' .,!?()')
```

If you want to use `tokens` as a positional argument, any arguments that appear
before it in the function signature must also be positional arguments.
If you try to use a named argument for `paragraph` and a positional
argument for `tokens`, this will not work.

```zetasql
-- This doesn't work.
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  delimiters => ' .,!?()',
  paragraph => 'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.')

-- This works.
SELECT token, count
FROM CountTokensInText(
  'Would you prefer softball, baseball, or tennis? There is also swimming.',
  ['baseball', 'football', 'tennis'],
  delimiters => ' .,!?()')
```

## Lambdas 
<a id="lambdas"></a>

**Syntax:**

```zetasql
(arg[, ...]) -> body_expression
```

```zetasql
arg -> body_expression
```

**Description**

For some functions, ZetaSQL supports lambdas as builtin function
arguments. A lambda takes a list of arguments and an expression as the lambda
body.

+   `arg`:
    +   Name of the lambda argument is defined by the user.
    +   No type is specified for the lambda argument. The type is inferred from
        the context.
+   `body_expression`:
    +   The lambda body can be any valid scalar expression.

## SAFE. prefix

**Syntax:**

```
SAFE.function_name()
```

**Description**

If you begin a function with
the `SAFE.` prefix, it will return `NULL` instead of an error.
The `SAFE.` prefix only prevents errors from the prefixed function
itself: it doesn't prevent errors that occur while evaluating argument
expressions. The `SAFE.` prefix only prevents errors that occur because of the
value of the function inputs, such as "value out of range" errors; other
errors, such as internal or system errors, may still occur. If the function
doesn't return an error, `SAFE.` has no effect on the output.

**Exclusions**

+ [Operators][link-to-operators], such as `+` and `=`, don't support the
  `SAFE.` prefix. To prevent errors from a
   division operation, use [SAFE_DIVIDE][link-to-SAFE_DIVIDE].
+ Some operators, such as `IN`, `ARRAY`, and `UNNEST`, resemble functions but
  don't support the `SAFE.` prefix.
+ The `CAST` and `EXTRACT` functions don't support the `SAFE.`
  prefix. To prevent errors from casting, use
  [SAFE_CAST][link-to-SAFE_CAST].

**Example**

In the following example, the first use of the `SUBSTR` function would normally
return an error, because the function doesn't support length arguments with
negative values. However, the `SAFE.` prefix causes the function to return
`NULL` instead. The second use of the `SUBSTR` function provides the expected
output: the `SAFE.` prefix has no effect.

```zetasql
SELECT SAFE.SUBSTR('foo', 0, -2) AS safe_output UNION ALL
SELECT SAFE.SUBSTR('bar', 0, 2) AS safe_output;

/*-------------+
 | safe_output |
 +-------------+
 | NULL        |
 | ba          |
 +-------------*/
```
