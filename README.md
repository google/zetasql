## ZetaSQL - Analyzer Framework for SQL

ZetaSQL defines a language (grammar, types, data model, and semantics) as well
as a parser and analyzer.  It is not itself a database or query engine. Instead
it is intended to be used by multiple engines wanting to provide consistent
behavior for all semantic analysis, name resolution, type checking, implicit
casting, etc. Specific query engines may not implement all features in the
ZetaSQL language and may give errors if specific features are not supported. For
example, engine A may not support any updates and engine B may not support
analytic functions.

## Status of Project and Roadmap

This codebase is being open sourced in multiple phases:

1. Parser and Analyzer **Complete**
   - Initial release includes only a subset of tests
2. Reference Implementation **In Progress**
   - Base capability **Complete**
   - Function library **In Progress**
3. Compliance Tests
   - includes framework for validating compliance of arbitrary engines
4. Misc tooling

Multiplatform support is planned for the following platforms:

 - Linux (Ubuntu 1804 is our reference platform, but others may work).
 - MacOS (versions TDB)
 - Windows (version TDB)

Until all this code is released, we cannot provide any guarantees of API
stability and cannot accept contributions. We will also be releasing more
documentation over time, particular related to developing engines with this
framework. Documentation on the [language](docs/) itself is fairly
complete.


## Flags
ZetaSQL uses the Abseil [Flags](https://abseil.io/blog/20190509-flags) library
to handle commandline flags. Unless otherwise documented, all flags are for
debugging purposes only and may change, stop working or be removed at any time.


## How to Build

ZetaSQL uses [bazel](https://bazel.build) for building and dependency
resolution. After installing bazel (we maintain support for 1.0,
but other versions may work), simply run:

```bazel build ...```

## How to add as a Dependency in bazel
See the (WORKSPACE) file, as it is a little unusual.

### With docker
 TODO: Add docker build script.

## Example Usage
A very basic command line tool is available to run simple queries with the
reference implementation:
```bazel run //zetasql/experimental:execute_query -- "select 1 + 1;"```

The reference implementation is not yet completely released and currently
supports only a subset of functions and types.

## Versions

ZetaSQL makes no guarantees regarding compatibility between releases.
Breaking changes may be made at any time. Our releases are numbered based
on the date of the commit the release is cut from. The number format is
YYYY.MM.n, where YYYY is the year, MM is the two digit month, and n is a
sequence number within the time period.
